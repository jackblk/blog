# Blog

My personal blog. Everything should be auto deployed.

For future me:

* Upgrade theme: `hugo mod get github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend`
* To create a new post, run `hugo new posts/my-new-post.md`
* Or just write to `content/posts/my-new-post.md`
* Run local server with drafts: `hugo server -D`
