# Blog

My personal blog. Everything should be auto deployed.

For future me:

* Upgrade theme: `git pull --recurse-submodules`
* To create a new post, run `hugo new posts/my-new-post.md`, or just write to `content/posts/my-new-post.md`
* Run local server with drafts: `hugo server` or `hugo server -D` to build with drafts


Note: the original theme [panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend) is not maintained anymore and I found [wilmardo/hugo-theme-hello-friend](https://github.com/wilmardo/hugo-theme-hello-friend) to be a better maintained fork which works with latest hugo 0.146.3.
