## **Connect & use Logitech F310 with Macbook**

Since my Macbook Pro only has USB-C port, I used an USB-A to USB-C adapter to connect my F310 to it, but it does not work (pressing MODE button does not turn on the LED).

### **How to**

To make it work:

*   Disconnect F310 from Mac
    
*   On F310: switch X-input to D-input
    
*   Hold **Logitech** button (in the middle)
    
*   Connect F310 to Mac via adapter, now you can release the Logitech button.
    

Now you should be able to use your gamepad.

Test:

1.  Try pressing **MODE** button, the LED should turn on/off.
    
2.  Use [Gamepad Tester](https://gamepad-tester.com/)
    

Notes:

*   Changing it back to X-input will not work
