## Boss Fight

Biggest tip is to be very patient. Only hit 1-2 times AFTER the boss does its attack.

There are some tricks that you should follow to make it easier.

### Fight on the platform

Easiest way is to fight on the platform

This should make the blades hit the platform, so you don't really have to dodge. Also, when the boss flies down, you can just drop out of the platform, lots of spaces to dodge.

### Healing

You can heal safely when the boss is on the left, just drop down to the water and heal

### When the boss is down

Use skills on the boss when he's down. Or just heal yourself.

### Second Phase

The boss will start doing this, flies on your head, fires blades on both left & right:

Simple rules:

*   **DO NOT HIT HIM** when he's above your head. If he's down because of it, he will fall down **ON YOUR FACE**.
    
*   Both blades should hit the platform, but it can occasionally hit you. So try to dodge.
    

Be patient and you should be able to kill him.
